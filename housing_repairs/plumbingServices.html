        <h2>Leak detection & repairs</h2>
        <p>
            Our team uses visual inspection and pipe-tracing tools to locate leaks quickly.
            We repair or replace damaged pipe sections and test the system to ensure there are no further leaks. 
            Work includes minor welding, seal replacement and pressure testing where needed.
        </p>

        <h2>Burst pipes & geysers</h2>
        <p>
            For burst pipes we provide emergency response to stop water flow and limit damage.
            For geysers, we perform safety checks, pressure relief valve inspections
            and full system testing after repair or replacement.
        </p>

        <h2>Drain unblocking</h2>
        <p>
            We clear blocked drains using manual and mechanical methods. We use: high-pressure water jetting, and camera inspection for persistent blockages.
            After clearing, we run a full flush and advise on preventative maintenance.

        <h2>Bathroom & Kitchen Installations</h2>
        <p>
            We install sinks, taps, toilets, showers, and related plumbing for bathroom and kitchen
            renovations. Work includes accurate measurement, secure pipe connections, water-tight
            testing and final finish checks to ensure reliability and a clean installation.
