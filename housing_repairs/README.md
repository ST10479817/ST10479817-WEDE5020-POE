By using consistent naming convention in the stylesheet makes all pages look consistent and joined with the same theme.

    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}"

I used all types of CSS properties to make my website look as perfect and readable as possible.

#### 2.4 Creating a Layout Structure

Organized content into semantic sections (header, mainContent and footer).

#### 2.5 Applying all Visual Styles 
I have applied all different types of styles to help create my website to look as applying as possible.
Styled navigation with hover effects, shadows and rounded corners.
Added an orange border line below the header and above the footer for a polished look. Created visually distinct service boxes with aligned images and text.
